Hello Sukai, 



Sorry for the delay this got tangled up in my vacation mail.  Perhaps you can read the work of Stephen Clark, Felix Hill, Karl M.  Hermann, among others at Google Deepmind who are focussing on learning  of language meaning inside virtual (game) environments. See e.g.,

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01719.pdf

and the self-cites therein. Also interesting in this technical  report which gives a nice overview of the Deep Mind work on grounded language:

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05672.pdf

I've only scanned the above papers, but I have attended recent talks by these folks.



This is all a far cry from DOTA, but any PhD project will need to  identify the core research question, which is likely to be more  foundational (e.g., about language & its understanding) than  learning to play a game effectively. So saying, advances in  understanding might be part of a larger system for playing DOTA or other complex  games.



If you could write a proposal, focussing on some aspects of  language that you think is interesting, and how you think it might be  improved / better understood / exploited in a game environment. Please  write a ~3 page document, motivating your problem, citing prior work, and outlining the plan for your thesis. Sound ok?



Best,

\--
